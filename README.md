1- How do I approach designing software?

Through my work on this project, I better understand OpenGL and GLFW functions. I have also obtained a better understanding of digital rendering through my work with complex 3D objects. When designing, I adopted the one step at a time method. I would render a complex object completely before moving it, then finally rescaling the object. Breaking a task down into bite-sized tasks can be applied to any future assignments/projects that I work on. 

2- How do I approach developing programs?

While developing my 3D scene, I found myself enclosing code in brackets to minimize sections of code within blocks/functions. This helped navigate the file significantly faster, speeding up development. The most significant change throughout the milestones was finding a way to render my entire scene with one shader program. This removed hundreds of lines of code and a lot of redundant code from my project. 

3- How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?

Computational graphics and visualizations helped me better understand problem-solving, which is invaluable in both my academic and professional careers. The course has also helped me understand the importance of time management, another critical skill as I move forward in my academic and professor careers. I found that once I fell behind, I was consistently three to four days behind schedule; in the future, I will remember the importance of managing one's time effectively.
